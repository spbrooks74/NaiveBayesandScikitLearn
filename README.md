# NaiveBayesandScikitLearn

Implement Naïve Bayes and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifiers using the Python Scikit-learn library.  Working with a sample dataset to implement a simple Naïve Bayes classifier that classifies the data into binary values.

In the second part, extend Naïve Bayes classifier to make predictions on more than two labels using the Wine dataset from the Scikit-learn library.

Finally, in the third part, work with a dataset that contains normal (ham) and spam SMS messages. Use a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether a message is normal (ham) or spam.
